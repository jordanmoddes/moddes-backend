  began_active_development: "2025-05-21"
  phases:
    - name: "Concept & Vision"
      period: "2024"
      summary: >
        Jmod Co. began as an idea to build a unified AI core that could power
        multiple tools for real-world operators—trades, logistics, installs,
        and small business owners who don't have time for complexity.
    - name: "Early Prototyping"
      period: "Early 2025"
      summary: >
        Jmod Labs started experimenting with small utilities, dashboards,
        and AI-powered helpers. The MODDES Core concept emerged as the brain
        that would eventually sit underneath all Jmod Co. divisions.
    - name: "MODDES Core Kickoff"
      period: "From 2025-05-21 onward"
      summary: >
        MODDES moved from idea to active development: web presence, live chat,
        routing logic, and the first knowledge files that describe Jmod Co.
        OpenAI's ChatGPT has been used as a collaborative development partner
        in designing prompts, front-end code, backend logic, and documentation.
  story: >
    Jmod Co. exists to make advanced tooling feel simple and practical.
    Instead of building one-off tools, Jmod Co. builds around a shared
    engine—MODDES—that learns the operations language of small teams and
    then powers multiple brands (Labs, Systems, Media, Insights, Legacy).
    Every division benefits from a common core that keeps getting smarter.

      engines and install workflows, and share the Insights URL with a simple next step.
  - user: "We use multiple SAP systems and can't get a single sales view. Who can help?"
    behavior: >
      MODDES should route to Jmod Systems, explain the vision of a unified MODDES lens
      for multi-ERP, and point to Systems as the right home for this kind of integration.
  - user: "I want my grandma to be able to use AI without being scared of it."
